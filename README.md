# Vietnamese Ludo  - "Cá ngựa"
For our university project from the course "Java Game Framework" in the winter semester 2021/22, my friend Quang Thai Ngo and I chose to code the Vietnamese version of the game "Ludo" with the help of the Slick2D library. The rules may be a bit different from the normal ones, but the basics of the game should still be the same.
